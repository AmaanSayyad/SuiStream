#   Challenges we ran into

- Navigating the uncharted territory of the Sui (Move programming language) presented a formidable learning curve for the team. However, through a collective effort, leveraging documentation, instructional videos, and the mutual support of team members, we not only conquered this challenge but also succeeded in building a robust platform. The journey of mastering this new language reflects the team's commitment to innovation and the willingness to explore and learn in pursuit of our project's success. Zklogin, Smart Contracts(Move), Wallet integration and implementation was pretty new to us.
